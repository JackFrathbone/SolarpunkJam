  - dialogueText: Oh yeah! So like, I've got a pretty good eco-friendly setup here
      and I wanna help the whole town get eco-friendly too!
    isPlayer: 0
  - dialogueText: But like, that doesn't mean just turning everything green!  We
      need semi-desert like the Karoo, not everywhere should look like Yosemite forrest.
      Being here made me realize that! Can't just throw in more trees everywhere
      and call it a day!

      I can do and you'll need it for later. <3
