  - dialogueText: Hallo! I'm RICKY and I'm the HEAD FARMER here in Dusty Dorp. I
      was the one who sent for you. I heard you believe in the movement we stand
      for. Do you like our flag in the town hall?

  - dialogueText: Yes! It reminds me of the back when I first started helping out
      communities like yours. So I know my END GOAL is to get water back to this
      FARM, but where should I START?

  - dialogueText: Go and chat to my sister MARIANNE at the COMMUNITY CENTRE on your
      left. Once you've helped both sides of town, come back here to help me finish
      off the FARM.
