      to meet you son. I'm FATHER PILLAY. \n\nWhat can I do for you?"

  - dialogueText: Pleasure is all mine. The mayor said I should talk to you to learn
      more about the town.

  - dialogueText: Aiyo! In our little Dusty Dorp times have been tough. After we
      hit DAY ZERO with our water supply we realized we all needed to come together
      and help each other out if we're going to survive. A little sacrifice goes
      a long way!

  - dialogueText: Ja, tough times make tough people, but helping each other out lightens
      the load through community.

  - dialogueText: "Exactly! Our community-run FARM is now the true heart of Dusty
      Dorp. We need water to flow from all areas of the town to the farm. \n\nAnd
      we need a professional like you to help us get there!"

  - dialogueText: "\rWhat we really want now is to get all of our spare water to
      the farm, but that will require you to connect both the neighbourhoods up to
      our central system. Chat to our head farmer RICKY about that."

  - dialogueText: "But, firstly you must go talk to MARIANNE. Such a lovely lady
      she is. \r\nShe has lived here for a long time and is now using her land to
      set up the new COMMUNITY CENTRE. She'll show you where to get started. \n\nGood
      luck and Godspeed handyman! \r"
