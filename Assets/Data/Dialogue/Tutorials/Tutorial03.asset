  - dialogueText: Perfect, just as I was trained to do. Now for the fiddly bit, which
      is wiring up power sources to water pumps with cables
    isPlayer: 1
  - dialogueText: So it basically works the same as water pipes, I just need to switch
      from pipe mode to cable mode, and I place thema and remove them just like pipes
      with left and right clicking

  - dialogueText: Water tanks with an attached pump need power to provide water.
      The tank above me has a pump that isn't connected to that nearby solar panel
    isPlayer: 1
  - dialogueText: I just need to grab that box of cables ahead, switch to cable mode
      and connect up the solar panel to the pump next to the tank
    isPlayer: 1
  - dialogueText: With both of these tanks workign I can fill up the ponds by the
      statue, as it needs 12 water and each tank provides only six. So I need to
      connect both to the tap
